Dialog push service
===================

Dialog Push Service (DPS) is a tiny service for pushing remote notifications.

DPS consists of two sub-projects:

- [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) server that does actual delivery
- Scala module for [Dialog Server](https://dlg.im) which provides Scala bindings to gRPC server
